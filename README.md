Basic Typing Test

All that's needed for this program is a single level JSON file. 

The window has a text entry box for a file name (required to run). After entering the file name, 
press the Start button to display a line from the file. A timer will start and you will be able to type 
characters until you have reached the number of characters in the line of text displayed. The characters
you type will be displayed under the text box in red. Pressing the Enter key will end the program and 
calculate results based on what was typed in the text box since Start was pressed. The results will be 
displayed in characters/words per minute. Pressing the Reset button will clear all fields.
