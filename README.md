When running FinalProjectInTk.py, the test displays the text you type underneath the text box as you type. It converts to green (if all characters are correct)
or red (if characters were missed) upon ending the program.

Results are displayed as Words Per Minute, Accuracy (percent), and Adjusted Words Per Minute.

Press the Start button to display a line from the file, End (or Enter key) to get your results, or Reset to reset all fields.

A timer will start and you will be able to type characters until you have reached the number of characters in the line of text displayed
or you submit the text using the End button/Enter key. When the results are displayed, the text area is disabled until the program is 
reset with the Reset or Start button.
